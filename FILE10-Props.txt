REACT PROPS 
   
   1) Props in REACT:
         -> Props (Short for properties) are a way  to pass data from a parent component to child component in React.

   2) Data flow:
         -> Props enable a unidirectional data flow, where data is passed from parent to child but not the other way around.

    3) Immutable and Read-Only:
         -> Props are Immutable and cant be modified by the child component that receives them.

    4) Passing props:
         -> Parent component pass props to child component by including them as attributes in the child components JSX element.

    NOTE: 
        -> Props only get sent from parent to child
        -> Child component cant modify/change the props
        -> You can see any number of props
        -> They can have name and value
        -> It can be optional too.
